## How to Use the Cross-Links

### For Documentation Users

1. **Start with the right doc for your role** (from NAVIGATION-MAP.md)
2. **Follow "Related Documentation" section** to explore related topics
3. **Use MkDocs sidebar navigation** when HTML is generated
4. **Search for keywords** to find relevant docs across the site

### For HTML Generation (MkDocs)

1. All links use relative paths: `[Link](./file.md)` or `[Link](./decisions/file.md)`
2. MkDocs automatically converts `.md` to `.html` paths
3. Cross-references become clickable hyperlinks
4. Sidebar navigation auto-generates from link structure
5. Search indexes all linked documents

### For Documentation Maintenance

1. When updating a doc, check its "Related Documentation" section
2. Ensure links to related docs are still accurate
3. Add new links if new related documents are created
4. Keep CROSS-REFERENCE.md and NAVIGATION-MAP.md in sync

2. Generate ReDoc from OpenAPI spec
3. Copy coverage reports from JaCoCo
4. All generated files will use cross-linked HTML
5. Deploy to gh-pages branch for GitHub Pages

### Optional Enhancements
- Add back-links in decision and pattern files
- Create search index for keyword search

---

## Verification Commands

To verify all links are in place:

```bash
# Check all main docs have Related Documentation section
grep -l "## Related Documentation" *.md

# Count total links (should be 50+)
grep -h "\[.*\](\./" *.md decisions/*.md patterns/*.md deployment/*.md | wc -l

# Check for broken links (all paths should exist)
grep -h "\[.*\](\./" *.md | sed 's/.*](\.//g' | sed 's/).*//' | sort | uniq
```
