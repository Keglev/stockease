### JaCoCo Coverage ###
# The JaCoCo HTML reports are generated by CI during the test phase and are
# intentionally not committed to the repository. They are published to the
# project's GitHub Pages under the `coverage/` subtree by the CI workflow
# `docs-coverage-deploy.yml`. Keeping the reports out of the repo avoids
# merge conflicts and large binary diffs while ensuring the report is
# reproducible via CI on demand.
